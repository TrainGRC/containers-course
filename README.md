# Demystifying Cyber Risks: Containers
A course repository for the Demystifying Cyber Risks: Containers mini-course.

### Introduction
This repository containers a Dockerfile to build a "Hello World" Bash container image, your own custom container image, and the compiled binary for [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/releases), a free open source vulnerability scanner from [Aqua Security](https://www.aquasec.com).

### Task #1 - Build a Container Image
This task has students build their first container image. To do this, students will become familiar with AWS Cloud9, a web-based IDE. Students will also learn some basic commands associated with common developer tools, such as 'code'git'code' and 'code'docker'code'
